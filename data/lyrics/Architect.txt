Every word you said
Runs around inside my head again
Every conversation with myself,
my god, a therapist
No, you can't resist
You're the name of my apocalypse
Thank the lord, I didn't fall for it

But something inside of me
wants to change the earth
Build my kingdom, watch it burn
Chase the feeling, lift the curse
Teachers told me I'd never learn
I won't be the last but you won't be the first
Hit when I'm kneeling, do your worst

'Cause I'll take all your sticks and stones
Turn them into miracles
Let me let you know
I'm never gonna want your pity
Oh, no, no
Look at you so cynical
But if I let it go
Who else is gonna build this city?
'Cause we are who they say we are
And that's just fine
'Cause I was never gonna take them with me
Sticks and stones
Turn them into miracles
Let me let you know
Nobody else is gonna build my city

Drag me through the dark
Be the villain in my narrative
Dance upon my scars
How I truly love your arrogance
Future felt far
until you opened up the door for it
Oh, when you opened up the door for it

But something inside of me
wants to change the earth
Build my kingdom, watch it burn
Chase the feeling, lift the curse
Teachers told me I'd never learn
I won't be the last but you won't be the first
Hit when I'm kneeling, do your worst

'Cause I'll take all your sticks and stones
Turn them into miracles
Let me let you know
I'm never gonna want your pity
Oh, no, no
Look at you, so cynical
But if I let it go
Who else is gonna build this city?

Nothing is left, I'm letting you in
Take what you want, talking my life, my sin
Knew you were staying, so I built a city
Where all my shadows and demons can live
Nothing is left, I'm letting you in
Take what you want, talking my life, my sin
Knew you were staying, so I built a city
Where all my shadows and demons can live

Sticks and stones
Turn them into miracles
Let me let you know
Nobody else is gonna build my city
Sticks and stones
Turn them into miracles
Let me let you know
