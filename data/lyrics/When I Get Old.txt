Oh When i get old
I'll be looking back
Wishing it could last forever
Oh yesterday
Seem so far away

Long dress, No shoes
Summer nights
Golden and blue
It feels just like we're stuck
I side a picture frame
These memories never fade away

Whisper to me
We got the world
Right at our feet
And I just wanna sit right here and look at you
That's probably all I ever do

Oh When i get old
I'll be looking back
Wishing it could last forever
Oh yesterday
Seem so far away
Where did it go
All of the nights
All the time we spent together
Oh yesterday
Seem so far away

Wake up and smile
Cause you're beautiful
Those hazel eyes
When I get old that's all I wanna think about
I probably shouldn't say this out loud

High hopes
Big dreams
And a little scared
Way too naive
Thinking you always be mine
and never leave my side
At least these memories never say goodbye

Oh When i get old
I'll be looking back
Wishing it could last forever
Oh yesterday
Seem so far away
Where did it go
All of the nights
All the time we spent together
Oh yesterday
Seem so far away

Someday im running out of time
I'll see your picture in my mind
I'll keep our love frozen in time

Oh When i get old
I'll be looking back
Wishing it could last forever
Oh yesterday
Seem so far away
Where did it go
All of the nights
All the time we spent together
Oh yesterday
Seem so far away
